# Getting Started with Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://cn.vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/react-app/] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### After git commit & push

Your app will be deployed to [https://starlastarla.github.io/react-app/] automatically!
